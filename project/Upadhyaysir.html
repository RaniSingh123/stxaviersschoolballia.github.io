		Shiv kumar upadhyay sir ,an excellent teacher , teaches us mathematics. He is our class teacher.He teaches in school since last 10-12 years.He teaches mathematics from class 9 to 12.He  is also good in singing. One reason that all the students like him very much is that he always makes friendly behaviour with each students.He never gave pressure to student for the homework or for any other reason.He either gave homework because  in class he done all the question of books.He treat all the students equally.Everyone who know him, always like him because of his discipline, polity and behaviour like gentelman while talking with others. While  teching he never sees towards the book because he always remembered each question of the NCERT textbook  as he had solved each quetsion nearly about 50-100 times    </p></center>
